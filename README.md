## JODEL

Jodel is a javascript web-application developped at Université de Lorraine - GéoRessources Laboratory.  It's a basic web-app for formatting csv data analysis, and vizualising formatted data. It is focused on drillhole core data.  
THIS IS RESEARCH WORK so it's not bug free ;) 
## Installation
